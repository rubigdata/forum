# Forum 2021

Repo `forum-2021` serves the role of discussion forum for the 2020 Big Data students.

We can communicatie via the issue tracker functionality. Using the issues is at least as powerful as a Brightspace forum and much less cumbersome. Always check the [closed issues](https://github.com/rubigdata/forum-2021/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before posting new ones, or re-open an issue that has resurfaced.

For more direct interaction, meet us in the Matrix room (https://matrix.to/#/#rubd:matrix.org).
