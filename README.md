# Forum

Repo `forum` serves the role of discussion forum for the Radboud Big Data students.

For direct interaction, meet us in the Matrix room (https://matrix.to/#/#rubd:matrix.org).

Help us create a FAQ for the lab sessions at the [Forum Wiki](https://github.com/rubigdata/forum/wiki/), by summarizing recurring questions in the chatroom.

We can also communicatie via the issue tracker functionality. Using the issues is at least as powerful as a Brightspace forum and much less cumbersome. Always check the [closed issues](https://github.com/rubigdata/forum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before posting new ones, or re-open an issue that has resurfaced.
